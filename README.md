# Python Basics: Math and String Formatting

### Problem 1:
Write the code to create a random number from 1 - 100. Print the number generated.

```
Hint:
import random
randomNumber = random.randint(?, ?)
```

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Write some python code that has a loop that prompts the User for string input, and will only stop after the User enters ```q```. If the user doesn't enter ```q```, then prompt them to input another string. Continuing asking for input until they enter ```q```. 

*NOTE: Your code should handle both lower and uppercase ```q``` values.

### Problem 3:
Create a function that will loop until the user enters '0'. Ask the user to enter a positive integer number. Print 0 to that number and ask them again to enter a number until they enter '0'. Repeat.

### Problem 4:
Write some Python code that creates a random number from 1 - 10 and stores it in a variable. Ask the user to guess the random number. Keep letting the user guess until they get it right, then quit. Print the message ```Sorry, incorrect``` for each wrong guess.

#### Extra:
But the range for the secret random number to 1 - 100. For each wrong guess, include a clue to the Guesser as to if their missing guess was 'too low' or 'too high'.
